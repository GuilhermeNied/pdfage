# 📄 PDFage

The idea for this project came about when I was converting images to PDFs for my mother. She is a teacher and uses PDFs to print activities for her students. I realized how laborious this transformation was. I used my knowledge of reading and writing files with Streams, which helped me solidify these skills.
